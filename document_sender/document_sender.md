# Becoming a Document Sender

Publication happen through the ```/publishMessage``` method of the [e-Box Document Provider API](../openapi/ebox-rest-2.1.yaml)

The method uses a multipart HTTP POST to send up to 6 documents attached to a an e-Box Message. The API [fully support end to end streaming](#End to end Streaming Considerations).

## Minimal publication example

The following is pretty much the simplest publication request that can be made. It is comprised of the following http parts 
1) ``messageToPublish``: This part contains the meta information of the message

```json
{
      "messageToPublish": {
        "recipient": {
          "eboxType": "enterprise",
          "eboxIdValue": "0454079368"
        },
        "subject": {
          "fr": "ik ben"
        },
        "messageTypeId": "TEST_PILOT_5_ENTERPRISE",
        "senderOrganizationId": "0220916609",
        "senderApplicationId": "document:management:consult:ws-eboxrestentreprise:0220916609",
        "attachments": [
            {
              "httpPartName": "upfile1",
              "mainContent": true,
              "attachmentSigned": false
            }
        ],
        "bodyMainContent": false,
        "replyAuthorized": false
}
```

2) ``upfile1``: This part MUST contain the binary and basic meta information of the document. It is a standard HTTP binary file upload part which needs to specify the following information:
    - data stream: the raw data of the content
    - filename: the file name of the document
    - Content-Type: the mime type of the document
```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="upfile1
"; filename="MyTestDocument.pdf"
Content-Type: application/pdf

(data)
``` 

**Note**: The ``upfile1`` part and the extra meta information of the document are linked together through ``"httpPartName": "upfile1"`` in the ``messageToPublish`` part,

### Response

Provided that the request is correct one can expect a ``201`` status code to be issued with our without an additional information ``code`` in the JSON response body.

### NO_DIGITAL_USER response code

This code allows the Document Sender to know that the publication he just made was to a recipient that never visited his e-Box. 

This is the preferred method for a Sender to determine if the User uses his e-Box or not. An alternative to this is to use the [e-Box Federation WS]() but this requires to integrate with annother web service and does not fit the "e-Box First" philosophy we are trying to push. 

## Getting an Oauth Token for publication

The [oauth introspect example](../examples/ouath-introspect) shows how an Oauth token can be retrieved. 

The ``GetAccessTokenV3.getAccessToken()`` method is the one responsible of getting the token. 

Getting a token requires having cleared the oauth part of the onboarding.

## End to end Streaming Considerations

Order of HTTP parts is arbitrary, each part being linked to it's associated m√©ta data by the ``httpPartName`` property of the publication payload. This allows for end to end streaming on the Document Sender side. See the [Publication Profile Documentation for more information](../document_provider/publication_profile.md#Order of the HTTP parts).
